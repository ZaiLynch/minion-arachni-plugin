Minion Arachni Plugin
===================

**Pre-alpha**

This is a plugin for Minion that executes the Arachni tool. It assumes Arachni is installed on your system and that is is on the system PATH. 

Arachni is a free and open source web application security scanner framework.
More information available at [the official Arachni homepage](http://www.arachni-scanner.com).

The plugin is modeled in analogy to the Minion plugins developed by Mozilla:
* [nmap](https://github.com/mozilla/minion-nmap-plugin)
* [sslscan](https://github.com/mozilla/minion-ssl-plugin)
* [skipfish](https://github.com/mozilla/minion-skipfish-plugin)
* [zap](https://github.com/mozilla/minion-zap-plugin)
